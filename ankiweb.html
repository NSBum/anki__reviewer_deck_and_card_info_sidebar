This is an extended modification of the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1008566916" rel="nofollow">Extended Card Stats During Review</a>. You can show/hide the sidebar with the shortcut "Shift+C" during reviews or from the main window toolbar with Tools-&gt;"Card Stats". In the add-on config you can set if the sidebar is visible by default. The add-on remembers the last state.

This add-on supports night mode in Anki 2.1.20 (or the night mode add-on for older versions). The sidebar contents are different from the other add-ons. There are deck options, only card properties that are relevant (to me) and a shorter and less wide table of repetitions. This version makes it easier to configure what is shown in the sidebar (if you know some python).

<b># Compatibility to other add-ons</b>
This add-on does not work with the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2091361802" rel="nofollow">Progress Bar</a> (in 2020-06-08). This limitation also applies to other sidebar add-ons like "Extended Card Stats During Review", see <a href="https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/issues/39" rel="nofollow">this bug report</a>. "<a href="https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/issues/42#issuecomment-484445952" rel="nofollow">the fix will have to be implemented on Progress Bar's side</a>". Since this add-on is a modification of "Extended Card Stats During Review" which is a modification of "Card Info During Review" they can't be combined. It also doesn't work with the add-on "Warrior Mode - Stats &amp; Debug".

<b># Meaning of abbreviations used</b>
The add-on uses abbreviations in the sidebar so that the sidebar can be more compact.

On top for the deck options there is:
- "OptGr": Name of the option group
- "Steps": Steps ("New Cards" tab of deck options)
- "LSteps": Steps ("Lapses" tab of deck options)
- "GrIv": Graduating Interval ("New Cards" tab of deck options)
- "EaIv": Easy Interval ("New Cards" tab of deck options)
- "EaBo": Easy Bonus ("Reviews" tab of deck options)
- "IvMo": Interval Modifier ("Reviews" tab of deck options)
- "LpIv": New interval ("Lapses" tab of deck options)

Then you have "Ivl" for "Interval" and "cid" which stands for "card id". the "card id" stores the
creation time of card in a special format (epoch/unix time in milliseconds).

The columns in the revision table have the following meaning:
- "Date": the last time you rated the card
- "T" refers to the state of the card: Learned ("Lrn"), Review ("Rev"), Relearned ("ReLn"), Filtered ("Filt"), Defered/Rescheduled ("Resch")
- "R" means how you rated it: "1" means again, "2" means hard, "3" is good, "4" is easy (if you the v2 scheduler)
- "Ivl" is the interval
- "Ease" means the ease(ivlfct) property of the card: It's the approximate amount the interval will grow when you answer a review card with the “Good” button, see <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/stats?id=card-info" rel="nofollow">the manual</a>.

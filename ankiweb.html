This is an extended modification of the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1008566916" rel="nofollow">Extended Card Stats During Review</a>.

I made this for myself because I wanted to have support for the night mode add-on and see different info during review: see deck options, see fewer card info, have a shorter and less wide table of repetitions and have some styling. This version makes it easier to configure what is shown in the sidebar (if you know some python).

If you you run into problems with this add-on you should use glutanimate's original.

Use this version at your own risk. Feedback or improvements (concerning my changes) are welcome. It's best to open an issue in <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki20__card_stats_mod/issues" rel="nofollow">my github repo</a>). 

<b>Versions</b>
- 2019-06-25 night mode (2.1 only), drop support for 2.0
